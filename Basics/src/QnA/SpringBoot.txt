1. STS (Spring Tool Suite)tool used to develop the spring boot frame work
2. Annotations which are used to implement the spring framework. 
3. create spring project http://start.spring.io  (choosed - new spring starter project)
4. Spring container will take care of creating the instanaces of objects
- standalone application
5. @component - declare at the class level, spring container while instanstaite object will be created with out 'new' keyword
6. @Autowired - ClassA, ClassB, - if classB declared in ClassA. spring container will take care to create the instance but to
                known the ClassA/connected between two objects @autowired annotation will be used. 
7. @Qualifier - used to identify the class under @autowired / you can declare your won class name ie : @Qualifier("myclassB")
- Web application
8. Create a Spring boot web application - annotation support
9. MVC - structure format - @Controller annotation used for controller class
   - we need to create src - main - webapp - jsp pages need to create
   @RequestMapping("home") - home page is a jsp page  - if you want to redirect, you have to mention - retrun "home.jsp" 
10. if you want to mention return type as .jsp, .velocity .js etc.. need to mention at application.properties file
11. spring.mvc.view.prefix =/pages/
12. spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp


What is SOA Testing?  / REST services / RESTFUL Servcies
SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) Testing is a Testing of SOA architectural style in which the application components are designed to communicate via communication protocols typically over a network.
- SOA is a method of integrating business applications and processes together so as to meet the business needs.
Service requester (E-commerce site)   <-> Service provider (payment Gateway)
-SOA consists of various technologies. Applications built using SOA has various services which are loosely coupled.

SOA Testing should focus on 3 system layers
1. Services Layer / business layer - services exposed by a system derived from business functions. output / resultm- tracker service
2. Process Layer / controller -  collection of services which are part of a single functionality. / tracker  
3. Consumer Layer - website 

Service Oriented architecture (SOA) Testing methods. 
1. Business scenario driven data based testing
2. Regression testing
3. Service level testing
4. Functional testing
5. Security testing
6. preformance testing. 
7. Integration level testing.
8. End to End testing
9. Mock up service testing

Supports multiple protocols â€“ SOAP, REST, HTTP, JMS, AMF, JDBC

Web Services :
Web services are independent application components, which are available over the web.
They can be published, found and can be used on the web. They can communicate through the internet.

Spring boot:
new - starter project - name(service) - add dependancy - 
-service register (server)
-feign (declarative web service client )
-zuul (intelligent routing system)
- Rest repository (expose JPA repository )
- web - (Spring mvp with embadded tomcat)
- Hystrix - (circuit breaker cascading)
-lombok - to reduce bioler plate code
application.perperties - you can change configure properties like port, application name etc. 
application_cloud.properties
- service files (src) - it contails all the java service files
appropriate annotations
@EnableFeignclient
@EnableCircuitbreaker
@EnableDiscoveryclient

- controller files 
Microservice application - Divide the application into small applications and connect them through REST services.
Ex: customer domain , Discover, selection, Starreward, checkout, credit , order history
monolathic application - singleStone application
